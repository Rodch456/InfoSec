- **Security Features**: Authentication, role‑based access control, password recovery, and comprehensive audit trails.

## Goals
- Provide a user‑friendly interface for residents to report incidents.
- Enable officials to efficiently review, approve, and act on reports.
- Give administrators full control over users, memos, and system logs.
- Ensure data integrity and security through role‑based permissions and audit logging.
